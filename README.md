Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for the classical problem of computing the diameter of undirected unweighted graphs, namely, the maximum distance among all the pairs of nodes, where the distance of a pair of nodes is the number of edges contained in the shortest path connecting these two nodes. Although its worst-case complexity is O(nm) time, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges of the graph, we experimentally show that our algorithm works in O(m) time in practice, requiring few breadth-first searches to complete its task on almost 200 real-world graphs.
